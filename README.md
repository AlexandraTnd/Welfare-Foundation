# Welcome to Autistic Children’s Welfare Foundation

About ten percent people suffer from some kind of challenge and disability. If they are properly educated and trained, they can substantially contribute instead of becoming burden to the society. In developed countries, the Government takes responsibility for their education, training and rehabilitation. Our Government has also taken many measures to improve the quality of life of these challenged group of people.

In Bangladesh, we have many organizations working at various fields of disability but there is hardly any quality facility available exclusively for children with Autism. At this backdrop, we started Autistic Children’s Welfare Foundation, a parents run not for profit organization that will work to provide a quality life to Autism Community.
